How to connect your Arduino to the Watson IoT platform?

## What is Watson IoT
Watson IoT is a powerful service where you can display your data from your device online, from whatson IoT you can export your to Watson data platform were you can feed this data to an AI. In this README we are gonna focus how you can sent your data from an Arduino to the Watson IoT platform.

### Requirements
- NodeMcu
- Lightsensor



## Step 1 Make an account at IBM Cloud 
- Go to https://www.ibm.com/cloud/

- Click add the sign up button

![Form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjornkouw001/Watson-IoT/master/personal-details.png)

- Fill in the form with your personal details

- Confirm the mail from your mailbox 


- After you have confirmed your email and accepted the privacy statement you have to see this screen

## Step 2 Create an IBM Watson IoT dashboard 
Now we gonna make a dashboard for our IoT Watson application.

- Go to dashboards in the pancake menu
![menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjornkouw001/Watson-IoT/master/items.png)

- Click on create a resource  

![IoT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjornkouw001/Watson-IoT/master/menu-cloud.png)


- Search for "internet of things platform" 

![platform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjornkouw001/Watson-IoT/master/IOT-platform.png)


- Select the free version 

- Click on create 

- If everything goes well you then you have to see the screen right below otherwise make sure that the organisation is your emailadress and "choose a space" is on dev.

## Step 3 Add a new device to the Watson IoT platform
- Welcome to the Watson IoT platform now we gonna select a device for 
- Go to the menu and click on add device.
- ![Add-device-button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjornkouw001/Watson-IoT/master/Add-device-button.png)
- After that you get 2 chooses, choose create device type
- Choose a name whatever you want for your device 
- Write in the description what arduino you got for exameple ESP 8266 NodeMcu and go to the next page
- Write as model Node MCU and click next
- Skip the meta data and click on create 


## Step 4 Connect the Arduino 

## Step 5 data visualisation

## Step 6 Connect the database
